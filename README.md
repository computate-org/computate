## Try out the AI/ML Smart Device API Code Generation yourself

Try out the computate platform yourself

You can do AI/ML Smart Device API Code Generation with computate in your own OpenShift 
cluster by following the [Smart Device API Code Generation with AI/ML hackathon course](https://github.com/smartabyar-smartvillage/smart-device-api-generation-hackathon): 

- You'll need access to a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. 
- Ask your OpenShift Admins to install OpenShift AI and the [vscode-java ImageStream here](https://github.com/nerc-images/vscode-java/blob/main/cluster-scope/base/image.openshift.io/imagestreams/vscode-java/imagestream.yaml)
- Then follow the Jupyter notebooks in this course, starting with 
  [01-install-prerequisites.ipynb](https://github.com/smartabyar-smartvillage/smart-device-api-generation-hackathon/blob/main/01-install-prerequisites.ipynb). 

For an introduction to OpenShift and the Smart Village Platform built with the 
computate platform, follow our [free course we developed to deploy a working 
Edge-to-Cloud Learning Experience with computate](https://github.com/smartabyar-smartvillage/smartabyar-smartvillage-sandbox-course). It will guide you through launching a free 
Red Hat OpenShift Developer Sandbox
environment, deploying the same FIWARE and Smart Village components as the
Smart Device API Code Generation with AI/ML hackathon course, 
and teaches how to build a new Python microservice that animates
simulated traffic data on maps over time.
